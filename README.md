Read through the report to understand the formation of the problem and to retireve the MATLAB code for the solver.

This project uses Newton's iterative methods to solve for the Inverse Kinematics of a UR5 Cobot. 

Watch my video on how the solver works for a desired square trajectory and give scontrol input to make a square in space: https://youtu.be/xci_1yeBswg
